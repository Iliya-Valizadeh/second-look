# second-look

Finds recurring charges, price rises, duplicates and odd spending in your browser

## In plain words

TODO: three short sentences that a person with no technical background can follow.
Say what goes in, what comes out, and why someone would care.

## Try it

TODO: a live link if one exists. Otherwise these three commands:

```bash
make setup
make demo
make all
```

`make demo` needs no downloads and no keys.

## Result

TODO: one number with its [confidence interval](docs/glossary.md#confidence-interval),
compared against a simple [baseline](docs/glossary.md#baseline). Every number here
needs a row in [CLAIMS.md](CLAIMS.md) that points to `reports/metrics.json`.

TODO: one chart, with a caption that says what to notice.

## How I worked

- Evaluation plan, written before any results: [docs/eval_plan.md](docs/eval_plan.md)
  (TODO: the commit hash that added it).
- Decision records: [docs/decisions/](docs/decisions/).
- Error analysis: TODO: link.
- How ready it is for production, scored against Breck et al.'s checklist:
  [docs/ml_test_score.md](docs/ml_test_score.md).
- How the AI assistant was used: [AI_USAGE.md](AI_USAGE.md).

## How it works

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A[Input] --> B[Model] --> C[Output]
```

TODO: five lines of text that explain the diagram.

## What's weak

TODO: the main weaknesses, ranked by how much each could change the result.
The full list is in [docs/whats_weak.md](docs/whats_weak.md).
